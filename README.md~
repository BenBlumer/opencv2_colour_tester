OpenCV has wonderful features for tracking objects by colour. However, it can be tricky to figure out exactly which minimum and maximum HSV values you need to capture only the object you're trying to capture. That's what this is here for!

First of all: you require OpenCV2 to be installed. 

Then run this script (make sure your camera is plugged in!). You can toggle between the image that's filtered by the specified HSV values and the original camera image. 

You can also add additional cameras in case you're trying to do this for a system where you're looking at the same object from multiple cameras. Just look at the cam2 parts that I've commented out in the code.
